# Pneumonia Detection using Transfer Learning with VGG16

## Overview
This repository contains a pneumonia detection project using transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture. The model is trained on the Chest X-ray dataset available on Kaggle, specifically the [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset by Paul Mooney.

Pneumonia detection is a critical task in medical imaging. In this project, transfer learning is employed, leveraging the pre-trained VGG16 model. Transfer learning allows the model to benefit from features learned on a large dataset (ImageNet in the case of VGG16) and adapt them to the pneumonia detection task.



## Dataset
To use the dataset, you can download it from Kaggle using the following command in colab or jupiter notebook:
```bash
kaggle datasets download -d paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
```

##Colab Notebook
Explore the provided Colab notebook (your_colab_notebook.ipynb) for a detailed walkthrough of the project. The notebook includes data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
